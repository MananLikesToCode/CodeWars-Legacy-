# CodeWars-Legacy-
A documentation of all my challenges completed on my own on CodeWars. I solely do these for practice and also enjoyment. Challenges are labelled 8 kyu - 1 kyu. 8 is the easiest type of challenge, whereas 1 is the hardest. You cannot receive any "honor" unless you complete it alone. The first column is just the solution code, and the second is the question with the solution.
If anyone wants to give me a critique or is interested in networking my email is mss352@scarletmail.rutgers.edu.
